okay so this is forked from https://github.com/ton-defi-org/boc-parser-estimator/tree/main to fetch from the mempool and parse it automatically. most of the transactions that it fetchs are gram submit proofs or throw an error but rarely you can catch a boc from a dex swap. my idea is to listen to the mempool, parse the bocs as soon as you get them, detect if it is a dex swap, and trigger a sandwich from there. I tried to make my own free mempool watcher but i couldn't get it so i had to buy an api that lasts until September 9th.
